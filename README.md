# Fairness in health care

Analyses about fairness in health care:

Up until now, most of previous work with regards to fairness and accountabilityhave focused on datasets that explore criminal cases or credit loans. In such settings,fairness metrics related to representativeness are important in order to address social and historical inequities [Saxena et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03654). However, when the focus changes tohealth care domain, representativeness by itself is harder to be justified. Consider acouple of examples.  Initially, diseases like skin cancer will naturally have a higherincidence rate towards people with lighter skin. Another example is breast or prostatecancer, where some genders are naturally more affected than others. Given these characteristics, it is not yet clear how can researchers quantify fairness on health care.

This repo will contain analyses about this subject and will be part of my master's dissertation.
